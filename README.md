## About

What is a causal event? A causal event is an occurrence that directly leads to another event or outcome. It's the "cause" in a cause-and-effect relationship. GPT models do not understand causation. GPT models are built on a correlation framework. However, correlation is not causation. This chatbot hopes to supercharge Gemini's abilities, in hopes of understanding how we can make that jump from correlation into causation.
